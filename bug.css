The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the usage of the `calc()` function and the `::before` pseudo-element:

```css
div::before {
  content: '';
  display: block;
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  height: 20px;
  background-color: red;
}
```

This code intends to create a red block element before the `div` element, with width being 20px less than the container width. However, if the parent element's width is not explicitly set, or is determined implicitly (e.g., by the content's width), the `calc()` function might not work as expected due to the `100%` width not having a concrete value.
